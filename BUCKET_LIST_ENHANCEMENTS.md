## Dream Status Flow

```
solo ‚Üí shared ‚Üí planning ‚Üí scheduled ‚Üí cherished ‚Üí fulfilled
                              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
                         (reschedule)  (missed)
                              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
                          planning     shared
```

### Status Definitions:
- **solo**: Created by one partner only
- **shared**: Validated by both partners
- **planning**: Destiny date negotiation in progress
- **scheduled**: Destiny date confirmed (future date) - **IN BUCKET LIST**
- **cherished**: Date passed but not marked - **IN CHERISHED MEMORIES**
- **fulfilled**: Marked as lived - **IN LIVED IN THE DREAM**

### Key Transition: scheduled ‚Üí cherished
**This transition is automated and coupled with the exact-time email notification.**

**How it works:**
1. Dream is scheduled with a destiny_date
2. Four email notifications are queued (24h, 1h, 10min, exact time)
3. When the "exact time" email job runs:
   - Sends reminder email to both partners
   - **Immediately updates dream status to 'cherished'**
   - Sets cherished_at timestamp
4. Dream appears in Cherished Memories section

**Why coupled?**
- Both events represent the same moment: "The dream's time has arrived"
- Ensures perfect timing synchronization
- More efficient than separate polling/checking
- Single source of truth (the queue system)
- Email sent = status updated (atomic operation)

**Failure handling:**
- If email fails but job runs: Status still updates (dream time has passed)
- If job retries: Status update is idempotent (checks current status first)
- Transaction-safe: Both operations succeed or job retries

## Database Schema Updates

    'edited',            // Counter-proposed
    'rescheduled',       // Reschedule request
    'remove_requested',  // Removal request

## New Console Command

~~**This section is obsolete - status update now happens automatically with exact-time email**~~

### Previous Approach (Removed):
- Console command `dreams:move-to-cherished` has been removed
- Scheduler is no longer needed for this feature
- Status update is now handled by `SendDreamReminderEmail` job

### Current Approach:
- When the exact-time notification email is sent
- The same job also updates the dream status to 'cherished'
- This ensures both events happen at the exact same moment
- More efficient and reliable than polling

3. **No Edit**: Cannot edit reschedule request after submission
4. **No Cancellation**: Cannot cancel removal request after submission
5. **Email Dependency**: Status update happens with exact-time email (tightly coupled by design)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dream Not Moving to Cherished:
- **Check**: Is the queue worker running? (`php artisan queue:work`)
- **Check**: Has the exact-time email been sent?
- **Verify**: destiny_date has passed
- **Check logs**: `storage/logs/laravel.log` for job execution
- **Manual trigger**: Process the queued job manually via Horizon/queue dashboard

### Reschedule Not Working:
- **Check**: Dream status is 'scheduled'
- **Verify**: Date is in the future
- **Check**: Comment field is filled

### Cannot Remove from Bucket List:
- **Check**: Dream status is 'scheduled'
- **Verify**: Partner has confirmed if you requested
- **Check**: You're not confirming your own request

### Email Sent But Status Not Updated:
- **Check logs**: Look for "Failed to update dream status" in logs
- **Verify**: Dream still exists in database
- **Check**: No database constraints blocking the update
- **Note**: Job will retry 3 times by default
