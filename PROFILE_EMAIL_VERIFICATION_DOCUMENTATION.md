# Profile Management & Email Verification Feature Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the Profile Management and Email Verification features added to AmoreCanvas.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Verification System
**Purpose**: Ensure users own the email addresses they register with and update to.

#### Sign-Up Email Verification
- When a user signs up, a verification email is automatically sent
- Users cannot log in until they verify their email address
- Verification link format: `/verify-email/{token}`
- Token: 64-character random hex string stored in `verification_token` column

#### Email Update Verification
- When a user updates their email, verification is sent to the NEW email address
- Old email remains active until new one is verified
- Token format: `{token}|{newEmail}` stored in `verification_token` column
- Verification link includes user ID: `/verify-new-email/{token}/{userId}`

### 2. Profile Management
**Access**: Via "‚úèÔ∏è Edit Profile" button in shared-canvas navbar (top-right)

#### Update Name
- Simple form to change display name
- Validation: Required, max 255 characters
- Route: `PUT /profile/update-name`

#### Update Email
- Two-step process with verification
- Sends verification link to NEW email address
- Old email remains until verification completes
- User must click link in new email to complete change
- Route: `PUT /profile/update-email`

#### Change Password
- Requires current password for security
- New password must be confirmed (entered twice)
- Minimum 6 characters
- Uses Laravel's Hash::check() for current password validation
- Route: `PUT /profile/update-password`

### 3. Time Format Enhancement (AM/PM)
**Location**: Dream Destiny Planning page (`/dreams/{id}/plan-destiny`)

#### 12-Hour Format with Toggle
- Replaced 24-hour (0-23) input with 12-hour (1-12) input
